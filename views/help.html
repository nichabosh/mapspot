      <h2>üìç Getting Started with Mapbox</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          The Maproom project uses an open-source mapping platform called Mapbox. For the
          majority of this tutorial, we'll be working with a product of theirs known as
          Mapbox Studio, which is essentially like Photoshop for geographical data.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you haven't already, navigate over to the <a href="https://mapbox.com">Mapbox
          website</a> and create a new account. All maps you create and upload will be
          associated with this account, so be sure to save your password somewhere safe!

      <h2>üë®üèª‚Äçüíª Importing Your Data</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          For the purposes of this tutorial, I'm going to provide you with a <a download
          href="https://opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/1d4cb4e279c5485c95e1385769c9b723_28.zip">
          practice dataset</a> to work with. Though Mapbox accepts all different types
          of data, including KML, GPX, GeoJSON, Shapefile (zipped), CSV, and MBTiles,
          we're going to be using a zipped shapefile for this demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you've downloaded the attached data, navigate to the Mapbox homepage and
          click on your avatar in the top-right. A dropdown menu should appear with three
          main options: <b>Account</b>, <b>Studio</b>, and <b>Documentation</b>. Select
          <b>Studio</b> and, when the page loads, click the blue button labeled <b>New
          Style</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point, you're free to choose whichever template you like. Mapbox should
          provide a preview of what the map will initially look like off to the right, and
          the data you eventually upload will be superimposed on top. For visibility's sake,
          I would encourage you to select either the light or dark variation of the
          <b>Monochrome</b> style, both of which can be seen in the images below.
        </p>

        <p>
          Once you're in the editor view of the map, take a look at the toolbar located on
          the left side of the screen. Because we want to import our dataset as a new layer,
          select the <b>Layers</b> tab and click on the blue plus icon. This should open a
          window titled <b>New Layer</b>, which is where we'll import and style the river
          data downloaded previously. Now, click the <b>Upload Data</b> button, navigate to
          the zipped shapefile, select it, and press <b>Submit</b>. After the upload has
          finished processing, select the dataset, named <b>River_Streams_Atlanta_Region</b>,
          as the source and rename the layer to something more appropriate. In the image
          provided below, I chose to name it <b>ATL Rivers and Streams</b>.
        </p>

      <h2>üé® Styling Your Data</h2>
      <div>
        <p>
          Now that we've uploaded our data and selected it as the source, let's first check
          to see what it looks like. On the map view, navigate to Atlanta, Georgia by typing
          the desired location in the hourglass searchbar (located in the top-right of the
          map view). Then, zoom in using the plus icon until the data is visible on the map.
          If you see a collection of black, veiny-looking lines, then congrats‚Äîyou've done
          everything correct so far! If not, go back and double check your steps.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because we're looking to display waterways, perhaps black isn't the best color to
          use. In order to change this, select your layer in the leftmost panel and click the
          <b>Style</b> tab if you're still in the <b>Select Data</b> panel (or simply press
          "<b>[</b>" on your keyboard). Now, using the gradient provided under the <b>Color</b>
          tab, change the data to a more fitting color. Once you've finished that up, you
          should be all done customizing the data! Go ahead and publish your map by clicking
          the <b>Publish</b> button located in the top right corner of the screen.
        </p>

      <h2>üè† Uploading to Maproom</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we've published our map, we must also make sure it's publicly-accessible.
        In order to do so, navigate back to <a href="https://studio.mapbox.com">Mapbox
        Studio</a>, click on the three vertical dots next to your map, and select <b>Make
        Public</b>. Next, click the three dots again, copy the <b>Style Url</b>, and
        navigate to the Maproom's <a href="/upload" target="_blank">upload portal</a>.
      </p><p>
        Here, you can provide a unique name for your custom map using the <b>Mapname</b>
        input field. In this case, I'm going to give it a broad title, "Atlanta Data",
        because I might want to add more Atlanta-related layers to the map in the future.
        Next, paste the copied style url into the <b>Style Url</b> textbox and navigate
        back to <a target="_blank" href="https://account.mapbox.com".>Mapbox Account</a>
        (in a new tab, of course) to access your account's public token. Scroll down on
        the page until you reach a section labeled <b>Access Tokens</b>‚Äîhere, you should
        see a <b>Default Public Token</b> of the form "pk.eyJ1IjoiYX". Copy this value,
        navigate back to the upload portal, paste the token in the <b>Public Key</b> input
        field, and click the <b>Submit</b> button.
      </p><p>
        If done correctly, you should be met with a message claiming that "Your map is
        pending approval". This means it has been successfully uploaded through our portal
        and will be displayed on the live site once we're able to verify and approve it,
        so just sit tight for the time being! In the meantime, feel free to check out some
        of the other <a href="/">approved maps</a>.
